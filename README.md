# UCB CS61A 2022FALL

Personal solutions of this course.

Thanks to the [2022Fall-CS61A](https://github.com/jianweiyecs/2022Fall-CS61A) from [jianweiyecs](https://github.com/jianweiyecs). The raw none-done code in this repository is from there.

*Recently, there are some problems on the UCB official website of this course. The none done materials - homework, labs, and projects - have been committed in this repository. They could be found in committing history.*
